The object of the game is to be the last player with chips.
You can have up to 50 players with a minimum of 3.
Each player begins with 3 chips.
When it is your turn, you roll one die for each chip you have. The maximum is 3.

If you roll:
L -> Pass a chip to the left
R -> Pass a chip to the right
C -> Pass a chip to the center pot. These are now out of play.
* -> No chips are moved.

Good luck!
